# svm-kernel-tutorial-report
This project takes a closer look at different SVM kernels like Linear, Polynomial, and RBF by using visualizations and running experiments on synthetic datasets. It comes with a Jupyter notebook and a concise report that illustrates how the choice of kernel and hyperparameters can influence decision boundaries.
